# HCA/CGP Data Storage System (DSS)

The next genation CGP platform uses the [DataBiosphere/cgp-data-store](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/cgp-data-store)
as the data storage system in place of `Redwood`.

The [DataBiosphere/cgp-data-store](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/cgp-data-store)
is a fork of the [HumanCellAtlas/data-store](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/data-store) for use by CGP.

Currently the [cgp-data-store](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/cgp-data-store) is installed independently and manually,
according to the instructions in the repo readme.

The HCA team is currently (June 2018) working on improving the automation of the `data-store` through the use of
 [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

This directory contains supplementary instructions and configuration files.
